# Dynamic Programming

## Pre-requisites

### How to define a DP problem ?

1. Define the objective function
2. Identify the base cases
3. Write down a recurrence relation for the optimized objective function
4. What's the order of execution ?
5. Where to look for the answer ?
6. What's the time complexity ?
7. What's the space complexity ?
8. Optimize the solution by using a memoization table (top-down[recursion] / bottom-up[iteration])
9. Write code from the recurrence relation
10. Test the solution with edge cases
11. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and space complexity
12. Can we optimize it ?
13. Can we optimize the space ?
14. Can we optimize the time ?
15. Can we optimize the solution even further ?
16. If we can't optimize it further, let's talk about trade-offs
