# Graph

`G = (V, E)`
V -> Vertex
E -> Edge

## Type

### Directed Graph

#### Directed Acyclic Graph

DAG: Any vertex can not get back itself with any edge

### Undirected Graph

### Mixed Graph

### Multiple Graph

### Undirected Completed Graph

Any two vertexes have edge.

If vertexes number is `n`, then all edges are `n * (n - 1) / 2`

### Directed Completed Graph

Any two vertexes have two diff direction edge.

If vertexes number is `n`, then all edges are `n * (n - 1)`

### Weighted Graph

Edge has weight.
