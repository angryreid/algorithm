# Huffman

Huffman Tree

1. Conclude all frequency of each code. A -> 2
2. Generated the Huffman Tree with every root.
3. Merge two min frequency root as a new tree, and accumulate their frequency as the value of new node value.
4. Repeat step 2 and step 3.
5. Get final Huffman Tree.
6. Set left as 0, right as 1.
7. Get the Huffman code mapping.
8. None of code mapping is the prefix of others.
